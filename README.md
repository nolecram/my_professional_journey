# My Professional Journey: A Multi-Volume Series (1999–Present)

## What This Is

This is the entry point to a series of thank you notes—each one a walk down memory lane into a specific technological era, the people who made it meaningful, and the principles that proved durable even as the technologies themselves became obsolete.

These repositories aren't a resume or portfolio. They're a time capsule. A retrospective capturing how technology transformed, how the work evolved across continents, and how the foundations built in one era carried forward into the next.

## The Volumes

### [Volume 1: The Proprietary Era (1999–2006)](https://github.com/nolecram/my_professional_journey_Vol-1_The-Proprietary-Era-1999-to-2006)

Foundation-building in Rome across four companies: Atos, TeleAp, RSI Sistemi, and Avaya.

An era when proprietary systems felt permanent. A time capsule of Rome-based IT in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

### [Volume 2: The Cloud Transition (2006–2012)](https://github.com/nolecram/my_professional_journey_Vol-2_The-Cloud-Transition-2006-to-2012)

Six years with IBM spanning three continents: Rome, Dubai, and Melbourne.

The inflection point where cloud computing went from experimental to inevitable. From proprietary infrastructure (Tivoli, SmartCloud) to emerging cloud platforms (OpenStack). A grateful tribute to the mentorship, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing that shaped those years.

## Why These Repositories Exist

Fifteen years have passed since the IBM days ended, and in the relentless pace of technology, that's nearly a century. The platforms that dominated that era—proprietary, specialized, vendor-locked—have given way to cloud-native architectures and open standards. The world has moved on.

Yet looking back, the *principles* learned during those years remain surprisingly relevant. Systems thinking, governance, operations—concepts that transcended the specific technologies. These frameworks apply equally to modern cloud operations, just implemented through different tools.

This series is shared in gratitude:
- To the companies that invested in growth
- To the managers and mentors who shared knowledge
- To the colleagues and teammates who made those years meaningful
- To the technological moments themselves—frozen in time, no longer current, but still worth remembering

If you were there during those years—if you remember the regional meetings, the OpenStack enthusiasm, the shift from on-premise to cloud—then perhaps this is a welcome splash back into that era. You'll recognize the concepts even though the technologies evolved.

## A Note to Those Mentioned

If you're mentioned in any of these volumes—if you were a manager, a colleague, a teammate, or a customer—thank you. These repositories exist because of your mentorship, your collaboration, and your willingness to share knowledge.

This is not a résumé. It's a small tribute to the people and the technological moments that made these years valuable.
