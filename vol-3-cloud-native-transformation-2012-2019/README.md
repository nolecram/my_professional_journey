# My Professional Journey: Vol. 3 – The Cloud-Native Transformation (2012–2019)

## About This Section

This is **Volume 3** in a multi-part documentation of a professional journey spanning from 1999 to present. Each volume captures a distinct technological era and the principles that transcended it:

- **Vol. 1 – The Proprietary Era (1999–2006)**: [The Proprietary Era](../vol-1-proprietary-era-1999-2006/README.md)
- **Vol. 2 – The Cloud Transition (2006–2012)**: [The Cloud Transition](../vol-2-cloud-transition-2006-2012/README.md)
- **Vol. 3 – The Cloud-Native Transformation (2012–2019)** (This section) - The era of Open Source dominance (Cisco, Red Hat)
- **Vol. 4 – Software-Defined Everything & AI (2019–Present)**: [Software-Defined Everything & AI](../vol-4-software-defined-ai-2019-present/README.md)

## Why This Section

This volume is a tribute to the era where "Open Source" ceased to be an alternative and became the standard. It covers seven transformative years spent at **Cisco** and **Red Hat**—two organizations that were at the very center of the infrastructure revolution.

If Volume 2 was about the *emergence* of the cloud, Volume 3 is about its *standardization*. This was the period of the "Container Wars," the rise of Kubernetes, the maturation of OpenStack, and the fundamental shift from hardware-centric networking to Software-Defined Networking (SDN).

But more than the technology, this section honors the culture. The shift from proprietary vendor lock-in to community-driven innovation. The lessons learned about collaboration, upstream contribution, and the power of shared standards. It is a thank you note to the mentors who taught me that in a software-defined world, culture is the only true infrastructure.

## Introduction

This section chronicles a seven-year journey (2012–2019) through the heart of the open source infrastructure revolution.

From the hardware heritage of **Cisco**, witnessing the pivot to software and the birth of ACI and OpenStack integrations, to the pure open-source ethos of **Red Hat**, where the "upstream first" philosophy redefined how enterprise software is built and delivered.

These years were defined by a rapid acceleration of abstraction—moving from managing servers to managing clusters, from configuring switches to defining policies.

## Summary

This collection documents the era where open source and open standards became the bedrock of enterprise IT. It is a retrospective on the move from "lifting and shifting" legacy apps to rebuilding them for a distributed, ephemeral world.

This archive honors the open source communities and the brilliant colleagues at Cisco and Red Hat who drove this transformation.
